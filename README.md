Work in Progress

Code and Data for "A Retrospective Analysis of b-value Changes Preceding Strong Earthquakes" by Nicolas D. DeSalvio and Maxwell L. Rudolph (In Review)

- ```primary_code_and_data/``` contains all of the data and code to calculate the b-value time series, Traffic Light System (TLS) scores, and uncertainties. There are specific scripts to generate Figures 3, 4 and 5.

- ```post_processing/``` contains scripts that process the output from ```primary_code_and_data/``` to analyze the success of the prediction scheme. There are specific scripts to generate Figures 2 and S1 here.


Within `primary_code_and_data/`, the `b_output/` folder is currently populated with graphs used in the paper, while the images may be redundant, the file structure they are contained in is utilized by the code.
